# MailRuTask

Just fill dbconf.json with your values and run mojo server: "perl MyApp.pl deamon"

On "refreshing DB" page yu can fill DB with your images. Uploading 10^4 images took about 2 minutes for me, so be carefull with numbers :).

Uploading some more images when there are a lot in DB takes some milliseconds.
